<h1 style="font-family:Helvetica Neue"> Preface &amp; Recommended Specs </h1>

<p class="paragraph1">
Off the bat, I would <b>NOT</b> recommend doing this unless you have an explicit reason to switch to linux. This does not significantly change performance in a meaningful way.
</p>

<p class="paragraph1">
If you do want to do this, I highly recommend installing linux on a new and separate hard drive. Partitioning part of an existing hard drive that has Windows installed on it is asking for a Windows update to corrupt or even completely wipe your Linux OS partition.
</p>

<p class="paragraph1">
Doing this in linux means you are relying on graphics card support in linux, thus running into potential issues if there is a gap in support vs the Windows drivers. Considering this, I recommend the following as min specs:
<div class="para_indent">
<ul>
    <li>10 GB VRAM on your GPU</li>
    <li>3080/4070ti or better(or AMD Equivalent or better)</li>
    <li>32 GB RAM</li>
</ul>
</div>
The graphically issues you could face if you do not meet those could be exasperated because of the linux environment.
